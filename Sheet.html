<p class="destext">
    Desserts a confectionery course that concludes a main meal.<br />
    The course usually consists of sweet foods,<br />
    and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine or liqueur, <br />
    but may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items. <br />
    In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, <br />
    and most parts of China,<br />
    there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.<br />
    The term "dessert" can apply to many confections, <br />
    such as cakes, tarts, cookies, biscuits, gelatins, pastries, <br />
    ice creams, pies, puddings, custards, and sweet soups. <br />
    Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness.<br />
    Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create desserts.
